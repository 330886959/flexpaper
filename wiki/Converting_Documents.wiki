=Converting your documents using PDF2SWF=

Converting your documents using PDF2SWF if fairly straight forward. Documents are preferrably converted using the executable (not the UI). The following example shows the currently recommended setting for converting your document:

*C:\SWFTools\pdf2swf.exe Paper.pdf -o Paper.swf -f -T 9 -t -G*

The last 5 parameters specifies that:
 * *-f* : Fonts should be embedded, improves searchability in the document
 * *-T 9* : The target flash version is 9, improves stability since the viewer is built for v 9
 * *-t* : Inserts a stop between each frame, improves stability
 * *-G* : Makes the document smaller and faster to render

Please see http://www.swftools.org/pdf2swf.html for a complete list of PDF2SWF arguments and their explanations.
