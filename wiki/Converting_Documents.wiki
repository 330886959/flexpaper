There is a range of available converters, both commercial and free. The following example shows the recommended settings using the open source converter "PDF2SWF" which can be found here: http://www.swftools.org/

Converting your documents using PDF2SWF is fairly straight forward. Documents are preferrably converted using the command line executable. The following example shows the currently recommended setting for converting your document:

*C:\SWFTools\pdf2swf.exe Paper.pdf -o Paper.swf -f -T 9 -t -G -s storeallcharacters*

The last 5 parameters specifies that:
 * *-f* : Fonts should be embedded, improves searchability in the document
 * *-T 9* : Sets the target flash version to 9, improves stability
 * *-t* : Inserts a stop between each frame, improves stability
 * *-G* : Makes the document smaller and faster to render
 * *-s storeallcharacters* : Stores all character information about the texts in the document, improves searchability 

Please see http://wiki.swftools.org/index.php/Pdf2swf for a complete list of PDF2SWF arguments and their explanations.
