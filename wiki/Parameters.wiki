 * *Scale* (_Number_) : The initial zoom factor that should be used. Should be a number between 0 and 1

 * *ZoomTransition* (_String_) The zoom transition that should be used when zooming in FlexPaper. It uses the same Transition modes as the Tweener. The default value is easeOut. Some examples: easenone, easeout, linear, easeoutquad

 * *ZoomTime* (_Number_) The time it should take for the zoom to reach the new zoom factor. Should be a 0 or greater.

The parameters are passed using flashvars or by setting properties on the flexpaper component inside flex, depending on your choice of usage. The code block below shows an example of how the parameters can be passed using the pre-compiled flash version

                  SwfFile :       "Paper.swf",
